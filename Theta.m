% This program evaluates the indicator Theta of networks with 
% given class assignment (type)
% The input of the program is a square adjacency matrix a of 
% dimension n and a vector of dimension n describing the 
% assignment type(i)=q size(type)=n,1
% with q integer between 1 and Q identifying Q classes 
% Nrun_max is the number of random permutation used to calculate Theta
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The output of the program is the indicator Theta and the matrix W
% Code part of the Supplementary material: Assessing the relevance of 
% node features for network structure
